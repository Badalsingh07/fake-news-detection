Fake News Detection with Machine Learning
Overview
This repository contains code for detecting fake news using machine learning techniques. The project aims to automatically classify news articles or social media posts as either authentic or deceptive by analyzing linguistic patterns, semantic inconsistencies, and source credibility.

Features
Utilizes machine learning algorithms for classification
Extracts lexical, semantic, contextual, and stylistic features
Trains on labeled dataset to learn patterns of fake news
Evaluates model performance using various metrics
Requirements
Python 3.x
Libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib
Installation
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your_username/fake-news-detection.git
Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Prepare labeled dataset of news articles (real/fake)
Run preprocessing scripts to extract features
Train machine learning model using provided algorithms
Evaluate model performance with test dataset
Adjust parameters and features for optimization
